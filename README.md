# RuggedEdge AI Helpdesk

The RuggedEdge AI Helpdesk is a simple web-based chat interface that allows users to interact with our support system powered by advanced language models. This implementation includes frontend code to handle UI elements such as input forms and message containers, along with JavaScript logic for handling user interactions and communication with our backend services.

## Features
* User-friendly conversational interface for seeking assistance related to RuggedEdge products and solutions.
* Integration with RuggedFunctions repository containing backend functions responsible for processing user requests and generating accurate, contextually relevant responses.
* Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile viewing experiences.
* Utilization of popular libraries including Showdown (for markdown parsing) and Axios (for HTTP client functionality).

## Usage
Users can engage with the RuggedEdge AI Helpdesk by simply entering their queries into the provided text input area and pressing the Send button. The system will then generate an appropriate response based on available information from our knowledge base and other resources.
